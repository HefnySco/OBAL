# Projects Using OBAL


### All-In-One-Board


In this project OBAL is used with RPI-4. RPI-4 has four cores. Two of them are used to run OBAL and the others are used to run [Done Engage](https://www.droneengage.com"). This project allows OBAL to be controlled via Internet from any place in the world, and stream video via Internet. This is a pretty powerful project.
